# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It was challenging to the point where I still dont exactly understand the operations side of it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? As far as things that are within my control (rest, breaks, asking for help) I feel I've done most things right yet I still seem to struggle.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? The concept of having instances and being able to change them with attributes seems really useful when using like-with-like information rather within a block rather than having to spell everything out multiple times. The execution portion is what is troubling me.
